### What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?
  * It's a new way to give LLMs tools to do things like automate your browser and fill in forms.
  * Instead of writing JavaScript or TypeScript to control the browser, you write a prompt â€” just like you would when chatting with an AI assistant. Behind the scenes the LLM interprets your prompt and uses the Playwright MCP server to automate your browser.
  * You describe what you want to do, and the MCP server opens a browser and navigates, clicks, types and even uploads an image.
