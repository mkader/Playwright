* Test an application that requires authentication (logging in every time).
* With the Playwright MCP Browser Extension for Chrome and Edge, that's no longer necessary.
* Launch the MCP server against an existing browser profile — one that's already logged in — and test your app.

	1. The extension is available for Chrome, Edge, or any Chromium-based browser.
	1. Download the Playwright MCP extension.
	1. Unzip the file.
	1. Open chrome://extensions or edge://extensions in your browser.
