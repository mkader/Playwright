## Automating Form Submissions with Playwright MCP and a Prompt file
* Automate browser tasks — like filling out a form or uploading a file — without writing a full-blown test script?
* What if all you needed was a plain-text prompt written in natural language?

* With just a .prompt.md file in VS Code, I was able to:
  1. Fill out a form
  1. Upload an image
  1. Submit it — all hands-free

* And I can re-run it any time and easily update the prompt with a different title, date and guest for my event. No rewriting scripts. No code needed.

* my automation-fill-in-form.prompt.md file

# Automating Filling in a Form with Playwright MCP

Your goal is to automate the process of filling in a form using Playwright MCP.

## Specific Instructions

Navigate to https://forms.microsoft.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx?origin=NeoPortalPage&subpage=design&id=80hbxLsTi0STVrp7hjwhiVQUcKiUmipGrdOkizvcY89UN0hQV0FIWVBYVDRBWERQTERUTTlET0ZPSC4u&topview=Preview

### Fill in the form with the following details:

1. Show: playwright live

2. Date: 15 July

3. Time: 1:00 AM

4. Topic: Playwright Live - Latest updates on Playwright MCP + Live Demo

5. Upload image: "C:\solera\mcp\prompts\folder_after_run.jpg"

DO NOT SUBMIT THE FORM. 

Ask for a review of the form before submitting it.
```

* How It Works
  1. I ran the prompt using the Playwright MCP server by clicking the play button in VS Code.

  3. And just like that — the browser opened, filled out the form, uploaded the file, and submitted it for me.
  4. All powered by the LLM interpreting the prompt and interacting with the page in real time.
